# Controller-Design-for-a-Biped-Walking-Robot

This repository houses the code for the final project of the Linear Control course conducted by Dr. Heidar Ali Talebi during the Fall semester of 2020 at Amirkabir University of Technology. The project revolves around the design and implementation of a control system, specifically a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. The primary application of this controller is in managing an inverted pendulum system to emulate the human gait cycle, with a focus on potential applications in biped walking robots.
